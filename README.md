Question #1 - Goal - Identify Top Keywords (See provided dataset)

Questions to answer:
1. Please briefly describe your approach (10.0)
2. How did you define what “top” is? (5.0)
3. List the top 10 keywords here along with the metrics. If you’d like to show us a visualization for it, you could do that (20.0)
4. If you were unable to complete your code in the allotted time, please describe what more you originally intended to implement. (5.0)
5. If you had a few weeks (say 4-8) to do this task, what other approaches would you try and implement for this problem? (10.0)


Question #2
(a) Suppose you have a neural network that is overfitting to the training data. Describe two ways to fix this situation. (5.0)

(b) You are training a neural network with Adam and watching the negative log likelihood of the training set over epochs. Rather than decreasing, it seems to fluctuate around where it started. What is one change you could make to your training procedure that could fix this? (5.0)


(Bonus) Question #3
A perfect non-statistical natural language understanding (NLU) or generation (NLG) system would need to have a  huge amount of  knowledge of the world. 

(a)	Show why world knowledge is essential for NLU by naming two NLU tasks that in general require knowledge of  the world to perform perfectly. For each task, give an example where world knowledge would be useful or essential, but where knowledge of language alone would  not suffice. Justify your  claims. (10.0)

(b) Name an example of a  natural language generation (NLG) system and give two examples of laces where knowledge of the world (not just language) could be crucial in getting appropriate performance from the system. You can base your answers on what you anticipate the particular application requires,  and need not base it on knowledge of how the actual system works. (10.0)
